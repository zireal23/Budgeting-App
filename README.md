# 🛍️💸 My Budget App: The "I Broke My Piggy Bank" Edition

> A cute little app I'm building **not** because I'm secretly prepping for a career switch 💼  
> **not** because I'm learning React Native 🤓  
> **and definitely not** because I want to impress recruiters with side projects 🙃  

### 🚨 But because I spent ₹1,299 on a *fancy water bottle* that looks like a science experiment 🧪 and now I can't afford *dosa* for a week. 🫠

## 📱 What Is This?

A **simple, sleek, and slightly dramatic** budgeting app that helps me:
- Track every rupee I waste 💸
- Remember that *yes*, I *did* buy 3 pairs of sunglasses in one month 😎
- Feel a tiny bit of guilt before clicking "Place Order" on Amazon 🛒

---

## 🧾 Features (So Fancy, Yet So Desperate)

✅ **Add Purchases** — with full drama:  
  - "Was it online?" 🌐  
  - "Did I use my HDFC card again?" 💳  
  - "Was it *technically* an investment?" 🤡  

✅ **Composite Items** — for when I pretend 5 snacks are "groceries" 🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫 → 🛒

✅ **Linked Purchases** — group all "gifts for people who don’t appreciate me" 🎁💔

✅ **Toasts That Judge You** —  
  - "Saving purchase..." 🍞  
  - "You *really* spent ₹800 on *coffee*?" ☕😱

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Fine, You Want the Truth?)

Yes, it's built with:
- **Expo** + **React Native** (don’t tell anyone)
- **TypeScript** (because I like pain)
- **SQLite** (for offline crying)
- **EAS Build** (so my friends can install my financial regrets)

But again — **I am NOT learning Android dev.**  
I just want to stop buying *yet another black hoodie*. 🖤🧥🖤🧥

## 🚀 How to Run (If You Dare)

npm install
npx expo start


Scan the QR code with **Expo Go** and watch my spending sins come to life. 👻

## 📸 Screenshots (Proof of My Downfall)

🖼️ *Coming soon* — after I fix the "Add Item" screen to stop judging me.

---

## 🤕 Why This Exists

Because:
- I bought a **₹2,500 phone stand** that looks like a yoga pose. 🧘‍♂️📱  
- I have **7 open Amazon tabs** for things I don’t need. 🕳️  
- My bank app sends me **"Low Balance"** alerts like it’s my therapist. 🧠💔

This app is my **digital intervention**.

---

## 🙏 Special Thanks

To:
- **Amazon Prime** — for the 6-hour delivery of things I regret in 6 minutes.
- **My HDFC Visa** — for never saying "no".
- **Me, 3 months ago** — for thinking "I’ll save money next month".

No.
